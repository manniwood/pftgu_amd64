Jonathan Bartlett wrote my favorite introduction to Intel
assembly language programming on Linux, Programming from
the Ground up.

The book was published in 2003 (according to my PDF version)
or 2004 (my print version), and uses 32 bit assembly,
making it somewhat dated. 

This repo has all of the programs from the book translated
to 64 bit assembly.

This would be a good time for me to mention that I am not
an assembly language programmer, and that I learned as I went.

Also, the copyright page of Programming form the Ground Up
says "In addition, you are granted full rights to use the code
examples for any purpose without even having to credit the authors."
That is awfully gracious, but I want to be sure to credit
Bartlett's book.
